## The Page Loader Project

#### Description

_Page Loader_ is a CLI utility that downloads web pages, similarly to how browsers can save website pages for off-line viewing.

#### Features

- a custom download path can be set using the ```-o``` flag;
- the utility downloads all assets a page references and rewires the page so that the local copies of those assets are used when rendering.
